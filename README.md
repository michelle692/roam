# Roam: A Travel App
### Project Description
Log your travel experiences on an interactive globe that you can rotate, zoom, and click on to see the places you have traveled to.
After completing a trip, mark your memories on the globe by clicking "Add Location" and then searching for the city you visited. Add notes to remember your journey! You can also plan your future adventures using our wishlist feature. Add notes of landmarks you plan to visit or sights you plan to see when you go on the trip of your dreams.

### Features
The landing page consists of a globe that the user is able to add pins to. The pins are categorized into two lists - Wishlist and Travel History. When either category is selected, pins of the relevant list will appear on the globe.
